# Balatro Deck Reviewer

Mod for [Balatro](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2379780/Balatro/) to allow viewing of decks after a run has ended.

## Installation

Follow the installation instructions for the Balatro [ModLoader](https://github.com/Steamopollys/Steamodded/tree/0.6.0) to install Deck Reviewer.

## Known Issues

1. Hitting the back or escape button after viewing a run will bring you back to the play screen with no hands. Just reset the run from there.
2. View run button is slightly off center in the Run Win modal.
3. View run window does not always scale properly and minor UI issues.
